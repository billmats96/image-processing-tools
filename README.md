Implementation of Motion Blur Algorithms, Filters Design and Image Segmentation using MATLAB programming

This project involves individual work as part of the Digital Image Processing course of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Academic Year: 2018-2019

## A Brief Description 

* **Motion Blur Algorithms:** (Not yet uploaded) 
* **Filters Design:** Design Filters in the Frequency Domain (Ideal, Butterworth, Gauss) x (Low Pass, Band Pass, High Pass) x (Directional, Smooth Directional)
* **Image Segmentation:** Recognize and separate semantically-close image areas. Approaches Spectral Clustering, Non-Recursive NCuts, Recursive NCuts
